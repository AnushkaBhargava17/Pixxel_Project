# Cloud Cover Aggregation System

## Overview

The Cloud Cover Aggregation System is a Python-based solution designed to efficiently collect, process, and aggregate cloud cover data for satellite image acquisition planning. This system optimizes API calls, implements adaptive sampling techniques, and provides accurate cloud cover estimates for large geographical areas.

## Features

- Adaptive grid sampling for efficient data collection
- API request optimization with batching and parallel processing
- Spatial and temporal data aggregation
- Simple caching mechanism for improved performance
- Modular design for easy extension and maintenance

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- requests

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
2. Install the required packages:
pip install numpy scipy requests

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Cloud Cover Aggregator:

```python
from cloud_cover_aggregator import CloudCoverAggregator

# Initialize the aggregator
aggregator = CloudCoverAggregator("http://api.example.com/cloudcover", "your_api_key")

# Aggregate cloud cover for a specific area and time range
result = aggregator.aggregate_cloud_cover(
 min_lat=40.0, max_lat=41.0, 
 min_lon=-75.0, max_lon=-74.0, 
 start_time="2024-08-17T00:00:00", 
 end_time="2024-08-17T23:59:59"
)

print(f"Aggregated cloud cover: {result:.2f}")
